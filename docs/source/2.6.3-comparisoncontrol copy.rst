ANZCTR Step 3 - Comparator / control treatment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Occurrences:** Nil

**Input type:** Text

**Example input:** Participants in the control group will receive the standard care from a specialist gastroenterologist who has about 20 years of working experience as a medical practitioner and 10 years as a specialist in internal medicine and gastroenterology.

The standard care includes reassurance and medication targeting the most troublesome symptoms (including fibre supplementation, anti-depressants, antispasmodics and anti-diarrhoeal medications for symptom control). The gastroenterologist will justify the frequency and duration of consultation according to individual participant’s needs as routine clinical visits; therefore, the participant’s irritable bowel symptoms will be monitored throughout the 8-week treatment period (at least two visits at Week 1 and Week 8).

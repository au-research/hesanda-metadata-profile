**Definition:**

A policy statement and/or set of procedures that addresses secondary use of the dataset. This would commonly be presented as a publicly accessible document or webpage that details items such as the following:

* Governance roles and responsibilities
* Regulatory requirements (e.g. legal, ethical, funding)
* Requirements for requesting data access (e.g. procedures, time frames, costs)
* Requirements for management and handling of shared data (e.g. storage and disposal, reporting)

Data sharing policies are broad in nature and represent the general position of the data custodian regarding sharing of the dataset. It is common for a specific data sharing agreement to be signed by the requestor and custodian prior to the release of data in response to a data request. Data sharing agreements are contracts between two or more parties that articulate the specific terms and conditions for the sharing of data for a specific purpose. The data sharing policy may be cited in the terms of the data sharing agreement if required.
